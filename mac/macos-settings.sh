# Why: This allows the function keys to be used as standard function keys
# without needing to hold the 'Fn' key, which is useful for users who
# frequently use these keys for shortcuts or other applications.

# Why: For some reason, mission control doesnâ€™t like that AeroSpace puts a lot
# of windows in the bottom right corner of the screen. Mission control shows
# windows too small even there is enough space to show them bigger.

# Why: People report all sorts of weird issues related to focus and performance
