# Enable "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" setting

# without needing to hold the 'Fn' key, which is useful for users who
# frequently use these keys for shortcuts or other applications.

# Disable "Press and hold keys"

# Why: By default, pressing and holding a key will result in a menu of
# accented characters. This can be annoying for users who frequently use
# these keys for shortcuts or prefer them to repeat the character.

# Enable 'Group windows by application' setting

# Why: For some reason, mission control doesnâ€™t like that AeroSpace puts a lot
# of windows in the bottom right corner of the screen. Mission control shows
# windows too small even there is enough space to show them bigger.

# Why: People report all sorts of weird issues related to focus and performance
